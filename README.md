I took a course in advanced C++ programming, focusing on language constructs, object-oriented principles, and key features of the C++ Standard Library. Designed for experienced programmers, it builds on foundational knowledge of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, offering deeper insights into the power and flexibility of modern C++.
